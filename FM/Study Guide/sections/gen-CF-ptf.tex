\subsection{Chapter summaries}

\begin{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}[label = {L.-5a}]{5a. Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return}
\paragraph{Net Present Value (NPV)}
Method consists of comparing the NPV of the cash inflows and outflows.
\begin{description}
	\item[$A_{t}$]	Cash inflow at time $t$ ("\textbf{A}ssets").
	\item[$L_{t}$]	Cash outflow at time $t$ ("\textbf{L}iabilities").
	\item[$i$]	The rate we believe could be earned on alternative investments with the \hl{same degree of risk}.
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]
		\item	a.k.a. the \textbf{cost of capital}, opportunity cost of capital or the interest preference rate.
		\end{itemize}
	\item[$P(i)$]	NPV at rate $i$.
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]
		\item	This notation is used as the NPV is a function of the interest rate $i$.
		\end{itemize}
\end{description}
\begin{align*}
	P(i)
	&=	\sum A_{t} v^{t} - \sum L_{t} v^{t}
	=	\sum (A_{t} - L_{t}) v^{t}
\end{align*}

\tcbline

\paragraph{Yield Rate or Internal Rate of Return (IRR)}
Because $P(i)$ can be negative or positive depending on the interest rate, we deduce there must be a rate such that it is equal to $0$. In fact, the solution such that $P(i) = 0$ is the IRR:
\begin{align*}
	P(i)
	&=	\sum (A_{t} - L_{t}) v^{t}
	=	0
\end{align*}

\tcbline

\paragraph{Note}	This can be solved by the calculator.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]
	\item	Access the cashflows worksheet through \colorbox{arsenic}{\textcolor{white}{CF}}.
	\item	Cash flows are the \texttt{C01} options.
	\item	The \texttt{F01} options are the frequency for the payments.
	\item	Press the \colorbox{arsenic}{\textcolor{white}{NPV}} button after cashflows are entered, enter the interest rate, then go down to the \texttt{NPV} field and hit \colorbox{arsenic}{\textcolor{white}{CPT}}.
	\item	To obtain the IRR of a series of cashflows, press the \colorbox{arsenic}{\textcolor{white}{IRR}} button followed by \colorbox{arsenic}{\textcolor{white}{CPT}} after entering the series.
\end{itemize}

\begin{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}[label = {L.-5b}]{5b. Is the Yield Rate Unique?}
For most transactions there is one positive solutions however in the theory there are as many as the degree of the polynomial in the equation $P(i)$ (i.e. the largest exponent). Situations where it is not unique are often somewhat artificial but they can happen. \\

This sections highlights the limitations of the yield rate as an answer to \og Is this a good investment? \fg{} and that there are other methods which are not part of the syllabus to answer it.
\end{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}

\begin{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}[label = {L.-5c}]{5c. Reinvestment Rates}
Two general scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin = *]
	\item	Suppose we have $1$ in a fund crediting interest at rate $i$.\\
			Annually, we withdraw the interest and reinvest it into another fund earning $i'$.
			Their accumulated value at the end of $n$ years is :
			\begin{align*}
			AV
			&=	1 + i \sx{\angln i'}
			\end{align*}
	\item	Suppose that we deposit $1$ in a fund crediting interest at rate $i$ at the beginning of each year.\\
			Annually, we withdraw the interest and reinvest it into another fund earning $i'$.
			Their accumulated value at the end of $n$ years is :
			\begin{align*}
			AV
			&=	n + i \Is{\angln i'}
			\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}

\begin{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}[label = {L.-5d}]{5d. Yield Rate Earned by a Fund}
\begin{description}
	\item[$A$]	Amount in the fund at the beginning of the year.
	\item[$B$]	Amount in the fund at the end of the year.
	\item[$C_{t}$]	Deposit in or withdrawal from (positive or negative) the fund at time $t$.
	\item[$C$]	Net sum of the deposits / withdrawals.
		\begin{align*}
		C	&=	\sum C_{t}
		\end{align*}
	\item[$I$]	Amount of interest earned in the period.
		\begin{align*}
		I	&=	B - A - C
		\end{align*}
\end{description}
%We thus have the relation $B = A(1 + i) + \sum C_{t} (1 + i)^{1 - t}$ which can be approximated with simple interest $B \approx A(1 + i) + \sum C_{t} [1 + (1 - t)i]$. We use this to isolate $i$ with $C = \sum C_{t}$ representing the net sum of the deposits / withdrawals:
%\begin{align*}
%	i
%	&\approx	\frac{B - A - C}{A + \sum C_{t} (1 - t)}
%\end{align*}

%We then define:
%and rewrite the approximation with the assumption that the net amount of deposits / withdrawals occurs at time $1/2$:
With this we approximate the yield rate as:
\begin{align*}
	i
	\approx	\frac{2I}{A + B - I}
\end{align*}
\end{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}

\begin{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}[label = {L.-5e}]{5e. Dollar-Weighted and Time-Weighted Interest Rates}
\textbf{Dollar-weighted} consists of isolating $i$ from the cashflows with the assumption of simple interest.
\textbf{Time-weighted} ignores how much time each transaction spent accumulating and multiplies balances. It is easy to make a mistake and best practice to draw a table. \\

See Coaching Actuaries' formula sheet for a good visualisation.

\begin{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}[label = {L.-5f}]{5f. Portfolio Methods and Investment Year Methods}
\begin{description}
	\item[Portfolio Method]	The yield rate is proportional to the amount members invested regardless of the date they invested.
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]
		\item	May seem unfair, but if there are losses the new members are the losers.
		\item	This is how savings accounts, TFSAs, etc. operate.
		\end{itemize}
	\item[Investment Year Method (IYM)]	The yield rate is proportional to the date members invested.
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]
		\item	There are several methods, but this is \hl{no longer on the syllabus}.
		\item	This is how a Certificate of Deposit (CD) operates.

\begin{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}[label = {L.-8a}]{8a. Bonds Preferred Stock and Common Stock}
A company can raise money with:
\begin{description}
	\item[Debt]	Bonds are a form of debt.
	\item[Equity]	Stocks are a form of equity.
\end{description}

\

There are a few types of bonds:
\begin{description}
	\item[Junk bonds]	Often used as a way to finance the takeover of a one corporation by another and are much riskier than investment grade bonds.
	\item[Investment grade bonds]	Bonds with a very low risk of default.
	\item[Zero-coupon bonds]	Bond without coupons in which the investor receives a single lump sum payment at maturity.
\end{description}
\end{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}

\begin{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}[label = {L.-8b}]{8b. Price of a Share of Stock}
The price of a typical preferred stock (or perpetual bond) is the PV of a perpetuity of the dividends (or coupons):
\begin{align*}
	P	&=	\frac{Fr}{i}
\end{align*}

%%%	--------------------
%%%	NOTE:
%%%	+	Don't think I wrote this right, need to verify for common vs preferred stock.
%%%	--------------------
With the \textbf{dividend discount model}, or \textbf{the discounted cash flow technique}, if the dividends $D$ for a common stock increase by a constant ratio of $(1 + k)$ we obtain:
\begin{align*}
	P	&=	\frac{D}{i - k}
\end{align*}
However this method is \textit{theoretical} as the future dividends of common stock are difficult to predict.

\begin{description}
	\item[Sector funds]	Mutual funds with investments in a particular sector.
	\item[Index funds]	No active management of the fund, it reproduces the results of the index it follows.
	\item[Load]	Commission to buy shares, but there are many \textbf{no-load} mutual funds as well.
	\item[Money Market Mutual Funds]	Invest in very safe, short-term debt instruments (for example, T-bills).
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]
%		\item	Usually no government deposit insurance.
		\item	Interest rates frequently change.
		\end{itemize}
	\item[Certificate of Deposit]	Deposit in a bank for a fixed term with a guaranteed interest rate.
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]

\begin{CHPT_SUMM_AUTO}[label = {L.-10a}]{10a. Duration of a Single Cash Flow}
\begin{description}
	\item[Fixed-income investments]	Investments that pay \textbf{fixed} (\textit{known}) amounts of future income.
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]
		\item	e.g., bond coupons, mortgage payments, etc.
		\item	Opposite of investments with \textbf{unknown} future amounts.\\
				e.g., dividends.
		\end{itemize}
\end{description}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]
	\item	Given that the \textit{future} income is fixed, the \textit{present} value of the investments depends on \textit{current} interest rates.\\
			Thereby, companies need tools to measure the impact that changes in interest rates have on asset values.\\
			e.g., duration, convexity, etc.
	\item	An issue arising from this is that a financial institution \textbf{guarantees} \textit{future} payments.\\
			However, its ability to fulfill them depends on the value of the investment it holds.
\end{itemize}
\begin{description}
	\item[Immunization]	Protection against the effect of future changes in interest rates.
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]
		\item	The institution tries to "immunize" itself from the impact of changes in interest rates.

\begin{description}
	\item[Price sensitivity]	of a bond to a change in the interest rate.
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = *]
		\item	i.e., the percentage change in price.
		\item	The greater the term of the bond, the more sensitive its price.
		\end{itemize}
	\item[Duration]	The time remaining to a single cash inflow or outflow.
\end{description}

Given the shape of the price/yield curve, a decrease in the interest rate will lead to a larger difference in price than an increase.
