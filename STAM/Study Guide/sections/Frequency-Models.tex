\subsection{Information}

\begin{distributions}[Objective]
The Candidate will understand and be able to perform calculations with commonly used frequency models.
\end{distributions}
%amaranth, amber, applegreen, ao(english), babyblue, blue(pigment)

\begin{outcomes}[Learning outcomes]
The candidate will be able to (for the Poisson, mixed Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, and geometric distributions, and mixtures thereof):
\begin{enumerate}[label = \alph*), leftmargin = *]
	\item	Calculate moments and generating functions.
	\item	Describe how changes in the parameters affect the distribution.
	\item	Recognize classes of distributions and their relationships.
	\item	Identify the applications to which each distribution may apply and explain why.
	\item	Apply the distribution to an application, given the parameters.
	\item	Derive and perform calculations with the zero-truncated and zero-modified versions of these distributions.
\end{enumerate}
\end{outcomes}
